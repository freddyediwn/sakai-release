# Cherry picking tips

When working on the actual source (not a fork)

```
git co master
git pull upstream master (ensure your master working copy is updated)
git co 11.x
git pull upstream 11.x (ensure your 11.x working copy is updated)
```
(Those steps are equivalent to chcherrypick.sh -u)

`git cherry 11.x master -v | grep SAK-31389`

This will return something like:

+ 0188650616ba6690e319db3c745345c7a3511252 SAK-31389 Cleanup buttonBar macro. (#2964)

The + sign means that this commit is missing in 11.x branch.

Then you can type:

`git cherry-pick 0188650616ba` (You donâ€™t need to use the complete hash string just the enough characters to identify the commit)
